 McGill Cycling has been  a part of the McGill community for nearly 30 years, and has a large base of students, alumni, and professors to show for it! Our members represent McGill at races across North America in a range of disciplines, and in the spring, we travel as a team to participate in the Eastern Collegiate Cycling Conference in the Northeast United States. Riders from a range of backgrounds, be it road, mountain, or even triathlon train with our club, as we encourage all levels of riders from the Montreal cycling community and beyond to take part in our events!

We are an official athletics team at McGill University, and alumni and students alike are encouraged to join as members. No previous racing experience is needed to reap the benefits of the team: all that is needed is a bike and the desire to ride faster!

The team communicates primarily on our forum, (found here), so check it out to see what we have coming up. From coffee rides, formal training practices, and potlucks, to training camps and race weekends, there are ways for everyone interested in cycling to get involved in the team!

Send a message our way if you are keen to get involved, or have any questions. We are always eager to have new recruits join rides, and to share our love for the sport!
